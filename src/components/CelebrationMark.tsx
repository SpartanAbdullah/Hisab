// The "you're clear" mark.
//
// A static tick says "this is true". A tick that DRAWS says "this just became
// true" — and that difference is the whole payoff of the Hisaab check ritual
// and of settling a debt. Those are the two moments the product exists for,
// so they get the app's only bouncy curve; everything else settles on the
// calm expo ease.
//
// Call sites: ConfirmationSheet with `settled` (a repayment that closed a
// loan — ring, pop, tick AND the confetti) and HisaabCheckModal step 4 (the
// daily ritual — ring, pop and tick only, burst={false}).
//
// Four layers on one timeline (see .animate-celebrate-* and
// .animate-confetti-bit in index.css):
//   0.00s  disc scales up past 1 and settles back
//   0.05s  ring expands outward and dissolves
//   0.16s  confetti bits leave the centre in five 40ms waves, fade by ~1.2s
//   0.28s  checkmark strokes itself on, left segment then right
//
// Ring, disc and tick are done by ~0.75s: long enough to register as a
// moment, short enough that it's finished before the user's thumb reaches
// the Done button. The last confetti fades a beat later, once the tick is
// already read, so it decorates the moment without delaying it.
//
// Geometry for the burst is computed ONCE at module load: it is pure and
// deterministic (src/lib/motion.ts), so every mount and re-render hands the
// CSS the same custom properties and an in-flight burst is never re-aimed.
