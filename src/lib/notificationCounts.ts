// What the bell is allowed to count.
//
// THE BUG THIS FILE EXISTS FOR — audit 08-notifications.md N-7:
//
//   "`InboxAction` counts pending requests where the user is sender OR
//    receiver (`InboxAction.tsx:18-33`: `r.toUserId === userId ||
//    r.fromUserId === userId`), then pulses a halo and rings the bell icon
//    whenever the count is nonzero. A user who sends one loan request to a
//    slow-to-respond cousin sees a red animated badge for days with nothing
//    to act on — the exact 'counter stays at 1' anxiety the codebase fought
//    elsewhere."
//
// The same class of mistake lived one layer down in `notificationStore`,
// which counted `!readAt` over every loaded row — so a row the user caused
// themselves, or one from a group they have since muted, still lit the badge.
//
// The rule, in one sentence: a badge is a PROMISE THAT SOMETHING NEEDS YOU.
// It may only count things that are (a) inbound — someone else's action,
// aimed at this user, (b) unread, and (c) not silenced by that user's own
// notification preferences. Outgoing pending requests are real and belong in
// the Outgoing tab's own count (InboxPage.tsx already computes that
// separately); they are not attention.
//
// Everything here is pure so it can be unit-tested without a store, a DOM, or
// a database — the repo's testing philosophy (vitest.config.ts header).

 *  app — `group_update`, the group fan-out — never lit the bell at all, and a
 *  user with hundreds of unread rows saw nothing. Deny-listing the two
 *  request mirrors instead of allow-listing four types means every NEW
 *  notification type is counted by default, which is the safe direction for a
 *  badge whose job is "something is waiting for you".

 *  (`buildInboxActionItems`), which has never been part of this badge and
 *  would make the bell depend on half a dozen full-tracker-only stores.

 *  `contact_link_requests` row and a `contact_linked` notification to the same
 *  user (supabase-migration-connections-push-discovery.sql:150-178), so one
 *  ask can count twice. The notification carries no request id, so there is no
 *  key to de-duplicate on; acting on the ask and reading the ping both drive

// ── Stale request mirrors ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

// `linked_settlement` notifications, against ZERO pending incoming requests.
// Every one of those pings is dead: it is either an outcome notice the
// triggers send the SENDER ("Shared loan confirmed",
// supabase-migration-linked-notifications-realtime.sql:58-63, 102-107) — whose
// request left `pending` at the moment it was written — or a request ping the
// user already acted on. Nothing in the app can ever clear them: the Inbox
// Info tab excludes mirrors and the card they refer to is gone. That is the
// "counter stays at 1" family, 73 rows deep, and it keeps `unreadCount` (the
// Activity tab's number) permanently wrong.
//
// The rows carry NO request id — `tg_ltr_notify` inserts `event_id` null and
// no params — so staleness is inferred from the pending set instead:
//
//   an unread mirror is STALE unless a request of the same kind, still
//   pending and addressed to this user, was created within `windowMs` of it.
//
// The trigger writes its notification inside the request's own INSERT
// transaction, so a live pair's timestamps agree to well under a second; the
// default window is minutes wide, which errs toward LEAVING a row unread. When
// nothing of that kind is pending — the founder's case — every mirror of that
// kind is stale, which is the invariant this is really for: if nothing of a
// kind is waiting on you, no ping of that kind may still be unread.
