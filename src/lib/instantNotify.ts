// Turns a freshly-arrived server notification into a real Android tray
// notification, immediately.
//
// Why this exists: Hisaab's only delivery channel used to be the in-app
// list. A backgrounded app therefore "notified" nobody — the user found out
// when they next opened it. FCM (see pushRegistration.ts) covers the case
// where Android has killed the process; this covers the far more common one
// where the app is merely in the background and its realtime socket is still
// alive. Between them the "I had to close and reopen the app" gap closes.
//
// Rules that keep it from becoming noise:
//   • Only fires when the app is NOT the thing the user is looking at.
//     A tray notification for a row they can already see is spam.
//   • Only unread, only recent — a cold boot must never dump three days of
//     history into the tray. The first load PRIMES the seen-set silently.
//   • Ids are derived from the notification row id, so the same row can
//     never surface twice (reloads, reconnects, multi-tab).
//   • Fires with no `schedule`, so it is delivered rather than pending —
//     notificationScheduler's cancel-all-pending sweep can't eat it.
