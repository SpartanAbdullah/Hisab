# Hisaab Play Store Data Safety Notes

Last reviewed: September 5, 2026 (launch alignment — push/FCM live, Sentry in the release build, analytics absent from this build, camera permission, receipts as Photos + Files, opt-in phone discovery, D1 deletion refusals, every migration applied)

This is the **single authoritative answer sheet** for the Google Play Console Data Safety form. `RELEASE.md` §9 points here; `docs/privacy-data-safety-inventory.md` is the long-form evidence trail behind each row. Every answer below was checked against the codebase, the production Supabase project, and the `versionCode 1 / versionName 1.0.0` release build on 2026-09-05. If the build changes (a new SDK, a new env var, a new permission), re-verify §1 before the next form submission — Play removes apps whose form disagrees with the bundle.

## Product Scope

Hisaab is a personal finance record-keeping app. It is not a bank, wallet custody provider, lender, money transfer provider, investment platform, or financial adviser. Kameti (committee) rounds are a savings rotation the members run themselves — Hisaab only records them (no custody, no lending, not gambling). Play's financial-features declaration is therefore **"does not provide financial features"** (personal finance manager / record-keeping).

## 1. Data Safety form — authoritative answers

### 1.1 Top-level questions

| Question | Answer | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? | **Yes** | §1.2 |
| Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit? | **Yes** | HTTPS only: Vercel-hosted PWA, Supabase REST/Realtime/Storage, Sentry ingest, FCM. The Android wrapper uses the `https` Capacitor scheme and no cleartext traffic. |
| Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted? | **Yes** | In-app: Settings → **Delete account** → type `DELETE` + enter the **current password** → confirm. Public instructions: `https://usehisaab.com/delete-account` (until the Vercel host flip, `https://www.usehisaab.com/delete-account` is what answers 200 — see §6). Deletion is **refused** in two cases the user must resolve first — see §5. |
| Does your app allow users to create an account? | **Yes** (email + password; 8+ characters with at least one letter and one digit, `src/lib/passwordPolicy.ts`) | Supabase Auth |
| Account deletion: in-app and via URL | **Yes**, both (same flow as above) | §5 |
| Has your app been independently validated against a global security standard? | **No** | — |
| Is your app designed for children / Families? | **No** | Target audience 18+ |

### 1.2 Data types — collected / shared / optional / purpose

Legend: **Shared** means transmitted to a third party as Play defines it (service providers acting on Hisaab's instructions — Supabase, Vercel — are *not* "shared" under the service-provider exemption, but Sentry and Google/FCM are declared as shared because the data they receive is processed under their own terms). **Optional** = the user can use the app without providing it. Nothing Hisaab collects is processed ephemerally.

| Play category → data type | Collected? | Shared? | Optional? | Purpose(s) | Evidence / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Location → Approximate location** | No | — | — | — | No geolocation API or permission. The IANA timezone string in `notification_prefs.tz` is a coarse label for quiet-hours scheduling, not a location. |
| **Location → Precise location** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **Personal info → Name** | **Yes** | No | Required (onboarding step 1 will not continue without a name, `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx`) | App functionality, Account management | `profiles.name`; also shown to other members of a shared group as `group_members.display_name`. |
| **Personal info → Email address** | **Yes** | No | Required | Account management, App functionality | Supabase Auth signup, login, email verification, password reset. |
| **Personal info → User IDs** | **Yes** | **No** (this build — PostHog is not enabled, see App interactions) | Required | Account management, App functionality | Supabase auth UUID, profile ids, group-member profile ids. Not attached to Sentry events (`sendDefaultPii: false`, no `userId` at any call site). |
| **Personal info → Address** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **Personal info → Phone number** | **Yes** | No | Optional | App functionality | Three places, all user-typed: (1) contacts' numbers in `persons.phone` and `committee_members.phone`; (2) a group **guest's** phone, stored only as a SHA-256 hash in `group_guest_identities` (hashing does not exempt the disclosure); (3) the user's **own** number in `profiles.phone_e164`, entered in Settings → phone discovery, used **only when "discoverable by phone" is switched on (default OFF)** so that people who already have that number saved can find them. The app never reads the device address book. `hisaab_mobile` (Settings profile card) stays in localStorage only. |
| **Personal info → Race and ethnicity / Political or religious beliefs / Sexual orientation / Other info** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **Financial info → User payment info** | No | — | — | — | No card numbers, bank credentials, or payment SDK. Account names/balances are "Other financial info". |
| **Financial info → Purchase history** | **No** | — | — | — | Hisaab has no purchase flow and observes no purchases. The expenses a user types in are self-reported ledger entries, disclosed under **Other financial info** below — do not also declare them as Purchase history. (`RELEASE.md` §9 must say No here too; it is aligned to this table.) |
| **Financial info → Credit score** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **Financial info → Other financial info** | **Yes** | No | Optional (user-created records; the app runs with none) | App functionality | Accounts, balances, income, expenses, transfers, loans and repayments, EMI schedules, goals, budgets, recurring entries, **investment records** (`investment_trades`), **kameti (committee) rounds and payments** (`committees`, `committee_members`, `committee_payments`), group expenses/settlements, any ISO 4217 currency. A capped projection of one contact's loan/repayment history can be exposed on a **khata link** the owner mints and shares (§3). |
| **Health and fitness → Health info / Fitness info** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **Messages → Emails / SMS or MMS / Other in-app messages** | No | — | — | — | No SMS/email/chat reading. Notes, report text and in-app notifications are app content, not messages between users in the Play sense. |
| **Photos and videos → Photos** | **Yes** | No | Optional | App functionality | Receipt photos the user attaches to a transaction (camera via `capture="environment"` or gallery, `src/components/ReceiptField.tsx`). Stored in the **private** Supabase Storage bucket `receipts` under `<uid>/…`, readable only by that account via 30-minute signed URLs; 5 MiB cap + MIME allowlist (`supabase-migration-p2-trust-safety.sql` §8). Deleted with the transaction and with the account. |
| **Photos and videos → Videos** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **Audio files → Voice or sound recordings / Music files / Other audio files** | No | — | — | — | No microphone permission or use. |
| **Files and docs** | **Yes** | No | Optional | App functionality | Receipt **PDFs** (same private bucket and caps as photos) and a user-selected `.json` backup file on import (read locally, then written to the user's own Supabase rows). Backup export hands the user a JSON file; it leaves the app only when the user shares it. |
| **Calendar** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **Contacts** | No | — | — | — | No `READ_CONTACTS` permission and no contacts SDK. Contacts are typed in manually; phone discovery matches only numbers the *other* person already saved themselves (opt-in, §Phone number). |
| **App activity → App interactions** | **Yes** | **No** (this build) | Required (generated whenever the app is used) | App functionality | Activity logs (`activities`), group events (`group_events`), edit history (`record_edits`), notification read state. **Not shared**: PostHog product analytics is *not compiled into this build* (`VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` is empty; no `phc_` key in the bundle), so no analytics purpose and no PostHog sharing is declared. The Settings consent toggle ("Help improve Hisaab", `src/components/TelemetryConsentToggle.tsx`, rendered in `SettingsPage`) exists but is inert without the key. **If a future build sets the key, update this row to Shared = Yes (PostHog Inc., EU), purpose Analytics, optional, and resubmit the form before rollout.** |
| **App activity → In-app search history** | No | — | — | — | Nothing stores search terms. |
| **App activity → Installed apps** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **App activity → Other user-generated content** | **Yes** | No | Optional | App functionality | Notes and descriptions on records, group event payloads, invite/request notes, block reasons (≤500 chars) and abuse-report reason/details (≤128/≤2000 chars — INSERT-only, operator-readable, never visible to the person they describe). A loan/transaction note can appear on a khata link only when the owner opts in (`show_notes`, default OFF, 140-char cap). |
| **App activity → Other actions** | No | — | — | — | Transaction creates/edits/deletes are already covered by **App interactions** above (`RELEASE.md` §9's older "Other actions" row folds into it). |
| **Web browsing → Web browsing history** | No | — | — | — | — |
| **App info and performance → Crash logs** | **Yes** | **Yes — Sentry GmbH (EU)** | **Not optional** (no user control) | Analytics | The release AAB is built with `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` baked in from the build machine's `.env`, so exceptions and stack traces go to Sentry. `sendDefaultPii: false`; no names, amounts, or user id attached (`src/lib/sentryReporter.ts`). The only way to answer "No" is to blank the DSN, rebuild + `cap sync`, and verify the Sentry host is absent from `android/app/src/main/assets/public/assets` — the form must match the bundle. |
| **App info and performance → Diagnostics** | **Yes** | **Yes — Sentry GmbH (EU)** | Not optional | Analytics | Same events: feature tag, app mode, language, environment, breadcrumbs. |
| **App info and performance → Other app performance data** | No | — | — | — | No tracing/replay integration is registered in `init()` (`tracesSampleRate` alone sends nothing without `browserTracingIntegration`). |
| **Device or other IDs** | **Yes** | **Yes — Google (Firebase Cloud Messaging)** | Optional (created only after the user turns notifications on in Settings; not ephemeral) | App functionality | The FCM push registration token, stored in `public.device_push_tokens` (`supabase-migration-connections-push-discovery.sql` §5) and sent, with the notification title/body/deep-link path, to Google's FCM service for killed-app delivery. Removed when the user signs out, turns notifications off, or deletes the account (`stopPushRegistration()` in `src/lib/pushRegistration.ts`; FK `ON DELETE CASCADE` to `auth.users`). No advertising ID, no other device identifier. |

### 1.3 Third parties to name in the form

| Recipient | What they receive | Declared as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Supabase Inc.** | All cloud-synced account, financial, contact, collaboration, trust & safety, khata-link, edit-history, notification-preference and push-token rows; receipt files. | Service provider (processor). Name it in the privacy policy; Play's service-provider exemption applies to "shared". |
| **Vercel Inc.** | Ordinary web request traffic to serve the PWA and the public pages. | Service provider (hosting). |
| **Sentry GmbH (EU region)** | Crash logs + diagnostics (§1.2). | **Shared** — Crash logs, Diagnostics. |
| **Google LLC (Firebase Cloud Messaging, project `hisaab-2`)** | Device push token + composed notification title/body/deep-link. | **Shared** — Device or other IDs. |
| PostHog Inc. | **Nothing in this build** (`VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` empty). | Do **not** list. |

### 1.4 What the form must agree with

- `https://usehisaab.com/privacy` names Supabase, Vercel, Sentry, Google/FCM; describes receipt photo storage, on-device camera use for the QR scanner and receipts, opt-in discoverable phone number, and analytics as "only if enabled in a release and you agree".
- `https://usehisaab.com/delete-account` describes the password prompt, typing `DELETE`, and both refusals in §5.
- The Android manifest declares exactly `INTERNET`, `CAMERA` (`required=false`), and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (merged from `@capacitor/local-notifications`, covers FCM) — nothing else. `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

## 2. Evidence — data collected, by feature

| Data category | Current code evidence | Required or optional | Primary purposes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Email address and authentication identifiers | Supabase Auth signup, login, email verification, password reset, and session persistence. Password policy: 8+ chars, ≥1 letter and ≥1 digit (`src/lib/passwordPolicy.ts`); change-password and delete-account both re-ask the current password. | Required for account access | Account management, authentication, security |
| Name and profile settings | `profiles`, onboarding, Settings, local storage cache | Name required at onboarding; other settings have defaults | App functionality, personalization, support |
| Financial information | Accounts, balances, income, expenses, transfers, loans, repayments, EMI schedules, goals, budgets, recurring entries, investment records (`investment_trades` + derived positions), kameti (committee) rounds and payments, notes, categories, and any ISO 4217 currency (`public.currencies`, `supabase-migration-p3-currencies-iso4217.sql`) | Optional user-created records, but core to app functionality when used | App functionality, sync, reports, summaries |
| Collaboration records | Groups, members, split expenses, settlements, invite records, linked loan and settlement requests, guest (no-account) group members | Optional, only when collaboration features are used | App functionality, user-requested sharing |
| Manually entered contacts | `persons` table; the optional contact **phone number IS cloud-synced** to Supabase (`persons.phone`, + `committee_members.phone`) — disclose Phone number = collected | Optional | App functionality for loans and linked records |
| User's own phone number for opt-in discovery | `profiles.phone_e164` + `profiles.phone_discoverable` (default **false**), `supabase-migration-connections-push-discovery.sql` §4, `src/components/PhoneDiscoverySection.tsx`. Stored only when the user types it in Settings; matched against other users' saved contacts only while the toggle is on. Turning discovery off keeps the number on file but makes the user unfindable; the number can be removed. The app never reads the device contact list. | Optional, user-initiated | App functionality — "people who have my number can find me on Hisaab" |
| Group guest phone (hashed) | A connected group member may add a "guest" (no Hisaab account) with a name and optional phone. The phone is normalized and **SHA-256 hashed** into `group_guest_identities.phone_hashes` before storage — the raw number is never written to that table. **No client role (not even the adding member) can read this table**: RLS is deny-all (`USING (false)`) and the table grant is revoked from `anon`/`authenticated`; only the `add_group_guest` write path and the `join_group_by_code` claim-lookup path touch it. Used solely so the real person can later claim the seat by joining with the same phone number on their own account. `supabase-migration-p2-guest-members.sql` §1–2, `docs/guest-members.md` §4, §9 | Optional, only when a user adds a guest with a phone number | App functionality — later self-claim of a group seat |
| Receipt photos and PDFs | User-attached photo/PDF of a receipt for a transaction. On Android the file input carries `capture="environment"` so the camera opens directly (`src/components/ReceiptField.tsx`); the gallery/file picker is the alternative. Stored in a **private** Supabase Storage bucket (`receipts`) under the owner's uid folder; the transaction row stores only the object path, and display uses short-lived (30 min) signed URLs. `supabase-migration-p2-trust-safety.sql` §8 enforces a **5 MiB size cap** and a MIME allowlist (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `application/pdf`) at the Storage API boundary, backstopped by storage.objects policies. Deleted with the transaction and with the account. `src/lib/receiptStorage.ts` | Optional, user-initiated | App functionality — attaching proof to a transaction |
| Trust & safety records | **Blocks** (`public.blocks`: blocker id, blocked id, optional free-text reason ≤500 chars) — one-sided; the blocked party can never read a row (no SELECT policy naming `blocked_id`). A "Blocked people" list with unblock lives in Settings. **Reports** (`public.reports`: reporter id, reported id, context type/id, reason ≤128 chars, details ≤2000 chars) — INSERT-only for clients, no SELECT policy at all; only readable via Supabase Studio / service_role for operator review, capped at 20/reporter/day. `supabase-migration-p2-trust-safety.sql` §1, `docs/trust-and-safety.md` §2–3 | Optional, user-initiated | App functionality — user safety/moderation, not shared with any third party |
| Khata link (public capability URL) | A user can mint a read-only, token-gated link (`create_khata_link`) that shows one contact's live balance to whoever holds the URL (e.g. shared over WhatsApp), with **no login on the other end**. The link exposes only: the owner's display name, the contact's name as the owner recorded it, per-currency net balance, that contact's loan/repayment rows, and the link's own settings — **never** a phone number, email, user id, or any other person/group/account. Two owner-controlled privacy toggles: `initials_only` (both names render as initials) and `show_notes` (default **OFF** — when off every loan/transaction note is NULL in the projection; when on, notes are still hard-capped at 140 characters). Only the SHA-256 of the token is stored; the raw token is shown once. Links expire in 90 days and can be revoked/rotated at any time. `supabase-migration-p3-khata-link.sql` §1, §5 | Optional, user-initiated (must actively mint and share a link) | App functionality — a counterparty who never installs Hisaab can see a shared living balance |
| Edit / change history | `public.record_edits` — an append-only, server-written ledger of who changed which tracked field (money, date, note, splits, participants — **never an account id, in either app mode**) on a group expense, group settlement, loan, or personal transaction. Readable only by the row's owner or, for group rows, a **connected** member of that group (same visibility as the row itself). No client can INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE it. Pruned after **180 days**. Surfaced via `EditHistorySheet` on loan detail, group detail and the group-expense editor. `supabase-migration-p2-edit-history.sql` §2–5, `docs/edit-history.md` §2, §5, §8 | Generated automatically from money-editing actions the user already takes | App functionality — dispute resolution / "who changed what" |
| Notification preferences | `public.notification_prefs` — per-user (optionally per-group) mute flag, optional quiet-hours window (local hours 0–23, Settings UI), and an **IANA timezone string** (default `Asia/Karachi`, or the device's own `Intl.DateTimeFormat` zone) used only to evaluate the quiet-hours window server-side. Self-only RLS; the "is X muted / in quiet hours" oracles are revoked from every client role, including the user's own — mirrors the block model. `supabase-migration-p2-notification-maturity.sql` §2, `docs/notifications.md` §3 | Optional (defaults: not muted, no quiet hours) | App functionality — notification fatigue control |
| In-app notification records | `notifications` table for group updates, requests, and kameti draw/round/payout events | Generated when applicable; pruned at 90 days (read) / 180 days (unread) | App functionality |
| Push notification device token — **LIVE in production** | Firebase project `hisaab-2`; `google-services.json` in `android/app/` (git-ignored). When the user turns notifications on in Settings, `requestPushPermissionAndRegister()` asks for `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, registers with FCM and upserts the token into `public.device_push_tokens` (self-only RLS). Delivery: `tg_notifications_push` → `pg_net.http_post` → edge function `push-notify` → FCM HTTP v1 → Google → system tray. `app_push_config` holds `edge_url` + `edge_secret` in production (`docs/push-notifications-setup.md`, status 2026-09-05). The token and the notification's title/body/deep-link path reach Google. Removed on sign-out (`stopPushRegistration()` runs **before** `supabase.auth.signOut()`), on turning notifications off, and on account deletion (FK cascade). | Optional — created only after the Settings notifications opt-in | App functionality — background/killed-app delivery of loan, group, and kameti notifications |
| Crash and diagnostic context | Sentry — **enabled in the release build** (`VITE_SENTRY_DSN` baked in at build time). Sends exceptions, stack traces & diagnostic context to Sentry GmbH (EU region). `sendDefaultPii: false`; no user ID, name or amount attached at any call site. No tracing/replay integration. `src/lib/sentryReporter.ts` | Collected; **shared with Sentry**; not user-controllable | Debugging, security, service reliability (Play purpose: Analytics) |
| Product analytics (app interactions) | PostHog (EU Cloud) — **NOT in this build.** The SDK is behind a dynamic import gated on `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`, which is empty for the 1.0.0 release, so it is never downloaded and nothing is sent. The consent toggle ("Help improve Hisaab", default OFF, `localStorage['hisaab_telemetry_consent']`) is rendered in Settings and stays inert. If a later release sets the key: fixed event catalog (`src/lib/telemetryEvents.ts`), enum/boolean/integer/bucket properties only, Supabase UUID as distinct id, `ip: false`, no autocapture/session recording — and the form must be updated first. | Not collected in this build | (Analytics — future builds only) |
| Local app data | Local storage settings, Supabase browser session persistence, local PIN record, per-user IndexedDB/Dexie read mirror (`HisaabDB:user:<uid>`), the FCM token mirror (`hisaab_push_token`) | Generated as needed | Session persistence, local device app lock (enforced — see §7 item 0), read cache only — **there is no offline write queue; an internet connection is needed to save entries** (decision D5, `docs/offline-story.md`) |

## 3. Sharing

- Hisaab does not include advertising SDKs and the codebase does not show sale of user data.
- Supabase processes authentication, cloud data storage and receipt files on Hisaab's behalf, including the trust & safety, khata-link, edit-history, guest-identity, notification-preference and push-token tables above.
- Vercel processes hosting and delivery traffic needed to serve the web app.
- **Sentry (Sentry GmbH, EU region)** receives crash and diagnostic information from the release build. `sendDefaultPii: false`; no user ID is attached at any call site (keep it that way or re-disclose).
- **Google (Firebase Cloud Messaging)** — **live in production.** A device's push registration token and the composed notification title/body/deep-link path are sent to Google's FCM service so it can deliver to a killed/backgrounded app. No account/financial data beyond what the notification text itself names (e.g. "Ali added an expense") is sent to Google.
- PostHog receives nothing in this build (no key). Declare it only in a release that sets `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`, and only as opt-in analytics.
- Users intentionally share limited records with other Hisaab users when they use groups, invites, linked loan requests, linked settlement requests, or group guest seats. With phone discovery **on**, another user who already has the number saved learns that it belongs to a Hisaab account (display name + public code) — nothing more, and nothing at all while the toggle is off.
- **A user can share a read-only "khata link" with anyone holding the URL — not a Hisaab account holder, and not a Hisaab third-party processor.** This is user-initiated sharing of a strict, capped projection of one contact's balance (never a phone/email/account id; notes only if the owner opts in, capped at 140 characters). The owner controls minting, revoking, and rotating it at any time. `supabase-migration-p3-khata-link.sql`.
- User-exported JSON backups leave the app only when the user downloads and shares them.

## 4. Encryption in Transit

HTTPS everywhere: the public website (Vercel), Supabase REST/Realtime/Storage, Sentry ingest, FCM, and the Capacitor Android `https` scheme. No cleartext traffic is permitted by the wrapper. Answer **Yes**.

## 5. Deletion

Users can delete their account in the app:

1. Sign in.
2. Open Settings.
3. Open **Delete account** in the danger zone.
4. Type `DELETE`, enter the **current password** (re-authentication, `verifyCurrentPassword` in `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`), and confirm.

The client calls the Supabase `delete_current_user` RPC, signs out (dropping this device's push token first), clears user stores, clears user-scoped local storage keys, and awaits deletion of the user's IndexedDB database. The RPC permanently deletes the matching `auth.users` identity. Existing foreign keys cascade personal money tables, receipts, push tokens, blocks, khata links and notification preferences; shared references configured with `ON DELETE SET NULL` are anonymized.

**Deletion is refused — with the reason shown in-app — in two cases (founder decision D1, 2026-09-04, live in production):**

- **`OWNED_GROUPS_WITH_MEMBERS`** — the user owns a shared group that still has other members. They must transfer ownership (group → *Assign another admin*) or archive the group first. `supabase-migration-audit-p0-account-deletion.sql`.
- **`UNSETTLED_GROUP_BALANCES`** — the user owes or is owed money in a shared group that still has another connected member. They must settle first — the same rule as leaving a group. `supabase-migration-p3-account-deletion-balance-gate.sql`.

The public deletion page (`/delete-account`, `src/pages/PublicInfoPages.tsx`) states both refusals and the password prompt; keep it in lock-step with the RPC.

**What survives account deletion, and how it is anonymized:**

- **Shared-group ledger rows** (`group_expenses`, `group_settlements`, `group_events`) a deleted user authored inside a group they shared with others survive for the remaining members with `user_id` set NULL — the ledger a group depends on is not erased by one member leaving it. Solo groups are hard-deleted.
- **Reports about, or filed by, the deleted user** (`public.reports`) survive with `reporter_id` and/or `reported_id` set to `NULL` (`ON DELETE SET NULL`, not CASCADE) — deliberately, so a reported user cannot erase the operator's only record by deleting their account. `docs/trust-and-safety.md` §3.
- **Edit-history rows the deleted user authored** (`public.record_edits`) survive with `actor_id` set to `NULL`. They are **not** relabeled to `actor_kind = 'system'` — that value is reserved for genuine server-side paths with no signed-in user — so a deleted user's past edits remain distinguishable from a true system action. `docs/edit-history.md` §2, §4.
- **Blocks, khata links, notification preferences and push tokens the deleted user owned are removed, not anonymized** — all `ON DELETE CASCADE` against `auth.users`.
- **Receipt photos** — `delete_current_user()` deletes the caller's `receipts/<uid>/` rows from `storage.objects` before removing the Auth identity (`supabase-migration-p2-trust-safety.sql` §8.3). **This is a logical purge, not a guaranteed physical one**: the file becomes unreachable through the API, but the underlying blob is not itself deleted by that statement. Do not represent account deletion as an immediate physical erasure of receipt image bytes in the privacy policy — `docs/trust-and-safety.md` §6.1.

A stale JWT cannot recreate rows because the Auth identity no longer exists and restrictive active-profile RLS policies reject the deleted user.

Public deletion instructions: `https://usehisaab.com/delete-account`. Users can also email `support@usehisaab.com`.

## 6. Hosting note (privacy / deletion / assetlinks URLs)

The canonical URLs are the **apex** (`https://usehisaab.com/privacy`, `/terms`, `/delete-account`, `/contact`, `/.well-known/assetlinks.json`). At the time of this review the apex 307-redirects to `https://www.usehisaab.com`, and www is what answers 200; the founder is flipping Vercel so the apex is primary (www → apex 308). Enter the apex URLs in Play Console — Google follows the redirect for the privacy/deletion pages — but the App Links verifier does **not** follow redirects, so `assetlinks.json` only verifies once the flip is done. The manifest host is the apex only; do not add www to it.

## 7. SDK and Permission Review

Current code review found:

- **Analytics:** `posthog-js` is in `package.json` but is **absent from this build** — it sits behind a dynamic import gated on `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`, which is empty, so the chunk is never downloaded. Do not declare analytics or PostHog. The consent toggle is rendered in Settings and is inert. Note `src/lib/analytics.ts` is NOT telemetry — it is the user's own spending aggregation for in-app charts and sends nothing anywhere.
- **Ads:** no advertising SDK found.
- **Crash reporting:** Sentry integration is **enabled in the release build** (`VITE_SENTRY_DSN` baked in). Crash/diagnostic data is collected and shared with Sentry GmbH (EU). `sendDefaultPii: false`; no user ID attached.
- **Push notifications:** FCM tier-3 delivery is **live** (Firebase project `hisaab-2`, edge function `push-notify`, `app_push_config` populated). Token stored in `device_push_tokens` only after the Settings opt-in; shared with Google. The app also has database-backed in-app notifications and device-local scheduled reminders that never leave the device.
- **Device identifiers:** the FCM registration token is the only one (declared above). No advertising ID, no device-identifier SDK.
- **Location:** no location or geolocation SDK usage found. The IANA **timezone string** stored in `notification_prefs.tz` is a coarse label used only to schedule quiet hours, not device geolocation — do not conflate it with a location permission in the form.
- **Contacts:** no native address-book permission or contacts SDK found. Users may manually enter contact names and phone numbers, including guest group members (phone stored only as a SHA-256 hash, unreadable by any client role). Opt-in phone discovery matches the user's *own* number against contacts other users typed in; it never reads a contact list.
- **Camera/photos:** the `CAMERA` permission **is** declared in the Android manifest (`<uses-feature android:required="false">`, so camera-less devices still install). It is used by the in-app QR scanner (`getUserMedia` in `src/components/QRScanner.tsx`, for connecting two users face to face) and by the receipt field (`capture="environment"`). Frames from the QR scanner are decoded on-device and never uploaded. Receipt photos/PDFs go to the private Storage bucket — disclose as **Photos** and **Files and docs**.
- **Notifications:** `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is merged in from `@capacitor/local-notifications` and covers both local reminders and FCM (one Android 13+ prompt).
- **Files:** JSON backup export and import exist. Import reads a user-selected `.json` file locally; no arbitrary upload feature beyond receipt attachments was found.
- **Clipboard:** invite URLs, khata-link URLs, and share text can be copied when the user requests it.
- **Payments:** no payment SDK found.

## 8. Human Review Before Submission

0. ✅ **PIN lock is real (corrected 2026-09-02).** `src/App.tsx` renders `PinLockScreen` as the last gate before the app shell — cold start whenever a PIN record exists, and resume after ≥ `PIN_RELOCK_AFTER_MS` (60s). PBKDF2-SHA256 at 150,000 iterations with a random per-device 16-byte salt and a persisted, exponentially-doubling lockout (`src/lib/pinCrypto.ts`). It is still a **local device gate only** (localStorage, not a keystore secret) — do not claim more than that. Offline: there is no offline write path — the inert outbox scaffold was deleted on 2026-09-04 (decision D5, `docs/offline-story.md`); an internet connection is needed to save entries.
1. ✅ Sentry **is enabled** in the release build. Crash logs + diagnostics are collected and shared with Sentry GmbH (EU); `sendDefaultPii: false`, no user ID attached — keep it that way or re-disclose.
2. ✅ Every migration in `supabase/tests/apply-order.txt` is applied in production (batches of 2026-09-03 and 2026-09-04, incl. `p0-launch-blockers`, `p2-trust-safety`, `p3-khata-link`, `p2-edit-history`, `p2-guest-members`, `p2-notification-maturity`, `p3-invariant-monitoring`, `p3-currencies-iso4217`, `p3-account-deletion-balance-gate`). `supabase-p0-security-verification.sql` passes. Nothing is pending apply. Provider backup retention after permanent Auth identity deletion: see `docs/ops-checklist.md` §5.
3. ✅ Contact phone **IS cloud-synced** (`persons.phone`), and the user's own number is stored in `profiles.phone_e164` when they enable discovery — **Phone number = Collected** (optional).
4. ✅ Android manifest permissions confirmed 2026-09-05: `INTERNET`, `CAMERA` (not required), `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (merged). Re-confirm after any Capacitor plugin change.
5. ⚠️ Confirm the published privacy policy and deletion page match §1.4 and §5 on the live host before submitting.
6. Review Google Play's current Data Safety definitions before completing the console form.
7. ✅ **Analytics resolved for 1.0.0:** `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` is empty → analytics is genuinely absent; do not declare it. The consent toggle is rendered in `SettingsPage`. **Before any release that sets the key:** update §1.2 App interactions (Shared = Yes, PostHog, Analytics, optional) and User IDs (shared with PostHog when consented), re-verify `src/lib/telemetryEvents.ts` has not grown a free-text property, and resubmit the form first.
8. ✅ All trust & safety, khata-link, edit-history, guest-member and notification-preference flows are live in production (migrations applied 2026-09-03/04) — declare them as in §1.2.
9. ✅ Receipts are declared as **Photos** and **Files and docs** (user-initiated, private storage, 5 MiB cap, MIME allowlist).
10. ✅ Push/FCM is **live**: Google/Firebase is declared as a third party for **Device or other IDs** (§1.2, §1.3). Re-check at every release that the token row is still self-only RLS and that `stopPushRegistration()` still runs before sign-out.
11. ⚠️ `docs/phone-auth.md` is a proposal only — no phone-OTP migration exists (`phone_verified_at` appears in no migration). Do not disclose phone verification as a shipped capability.
12. ⚠️ First upload is `versionCode 1 / versionName 1.0.0` to a **closed** testing track (new developer account: 12 testers, 14 days). Play App Signing is mandatory for AAB uploads; after the first upload, copy the Play app-signing SHA-256 into `public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` slot 1 (`docs/play-store-launch-tracker.md` Y7, `docs/ops-checklist.md` §1.3).
